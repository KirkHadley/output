There are different strands of Feminism, but the core claim captures the common thread between them all, and anything not sharing in this claim is by definition not Feminism. This claim represents the necessary and sufficient conditions for Feminism, without further necessitating how any particular feminist need express his/her beliefs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Core claim of feminism is thatmen and women should enjoy the same rights, privileges, and opportunities in a just and preferable society.One may immediately move to suggest we dont need Feminism because everyone believes that already. Well (1) thats not true and (2) even if it were true, women dont currently enjoy the consequences of that belief which is kind of the whole point of the belief. Furthermore, this claim should not be taken to mean that men and women should be treated the same. But the differences in treatment should be limited to those necessitated by genetic difference (e.g. the need for different kinds of doctors). Obviously this might suggest to a skeptic that men and women can be treated drastically differently as a result of their differing biology. But this idea is counteracted by a common thesis many feminists subscribe to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That thesis can be articulated expediently like so:there are few intrinsic differences between men and women.This thesis is not meant to suggest there are no intrinsic differences (hello, penises) and this claim also doesnt rule out men and women being different as a result of social forces (i.e.you cant reject this claim simply because you observe men and women acting differently). Though I dont intend to argue for this claim here, I will say there is good reason to at least consider taking it seriously, since humans have very little sexual dimorphismcompared to other species, a fact that goes against conventional (always read: ungrounded) wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core claim and the aforementioned thesis comprise the backbone of much of what is called Feminism, but there is certainly a lot of divergent thought. This is where I think Feminism loses some of its clout. The lack of a united front suggests weakness to feminist opponents. I, however, find this to be a feminist strength, as it shows the theory is investigative and not dogmatic. I do, however, think Feminism has historically dropped the ball on caring for all women. Black and transgender women were both ignored by earlier feminist advocacy initiatives. Fortunately, like any good theory, feminism has improved over time and recent waves of Feminism have been more considerate ofintersectionalityand global problems (also, to people who might say first-world women's problems shouldn't be our concern because women in other countires are facing more serious problems, I simply wonder who taught you that justice was a zero-sum entity for which only the most intense problems were eligible). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S. I was going to further use this post to explain all the amazing things Feminism has done for my life and the way I relate to women, but I decided against it. Feminism isnt about my life. Feminism isnt about me. The reason Feminism exists is because too many things in society are predicated on my convenience. Also, Im not a feminist because of the benefits to myself. Im a feminist, well, because I believe men and women should enjoy the same rights, privileges, and opportunities in a just and preferable society. Do you?`&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>5 Ways to Undercut Racism in 2015</title><link href="http://pisgahanalytics.com/5-ways-to-undercut-racism-in-2015.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-01-01T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Juannell Riley</name></author><id>tag:pisgahanalytics.com,2015-01-01:5-ways-to-undercut-racism-in-2015.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I dont put much stock into the idea of New Years resolutions. I figure, why not change something you dont like as soon as youre sure you dont like it? To me it seems resolutions, in general, are just a way to postpone action; this hypothesis thoroughly supported by the Arab-Israeli conflict, which has seen numerous resolutions, but not much progress. But, Id be foolish to ignore how seriously our society takes New Years resolutions. So, in that spirit, here are five ways wecan drastically improve our dialogue about race in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lets stop making this struggle all about Black men.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aiyana Jones, Rekia Boyd, Yvette Smith, Tarika Wilson, Tyisha Miller, and many more women of color have died at the hands of police in very similar fashion to the stories we see on national media. We cant continue to remove their stories from our narrative of oppression. Black women, believe it or not, make up roughly fifty percent of all black people. Furthermore, the black woman, perhaps, feels the pressures of institutional racism more heavily than the black man, as entrenched poverty, marginalization in the workforce, and single-parenting are problems that black women face at a higher instance than black men. When we ignore black women in our discussions of race, we rob ourselves of a lot of data which provides further evidence to support the claim that people in our society are oppressed on the basis of skin color as a function of unjust laws and engrained biases and we also turn our backs on one of societys most vulnerable populations: our mothers, sisters, daughters, grandmothers, wives, and close friends. Just saying, lets do this together. (Also, there is nothing more hypocritical than suggesting that its okay that the black man be a synecdoche for black people because its how language is used and the black woman is implied. If you believe that, then you must also be content with the white person standing as a synecdoche for all people. That is also the traditional way to view things).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lets stop making the good cop bad cop distinction and acting as if the race of the cop is relevant.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is inconsequential to focus on the race of the cop. Whether it be a White cop, a Hispanic cop, or a   Black cop, the important thing to consider about the situation is how the way the situation is informed by the historical treatment ofblacks in this country juxtaposed, of course, with the drastically different, one might say privileged, white experience. The issue at hand is the relationship of authority to black bodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this also helps explain why phrasing the situation in terms of bad cops is ill-advised. If the real problem is systemic discrimination and oppression, isolating each episode of police aggression as the actions of one deranged manwith a badge undermines any attempt to establish correlations and identify patterns; things very necessary to show the institutional nature of the problem, and the likewise institutional nature a solution will have to have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about it this way: good cops do their job according to procedure. Stop and Frisk is a legal procedure which is purposefully used disproportionately against people of color (indeed, former Mayor Michael Bloomberg wanted more black people stopped and frisked, as 80% of the stops being comprised of 90% innocent black people, wasnt enough). Therefore, one might say that good cops disproportionately stop and frisk people of color, a somewhat paradoxical proposition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The laws and procedures are unjust. It doesnt matter if a cop is a nice guy who is himself not racist, he has signed up to carry out laws that function to intimidate, marginalize, and oppress people. He may not be a bad person, but he is employed in an institution that carries out the will of a racist, corrupt society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lets stop making these kinds of arguments: If [unarmed black person] would have been more compliant, [unarmed black person] would still be alive.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For starters, this line of reasoning is completely untrue. The stories of Sean Bell and Oscar Grant provide ample evidence that compliance does not guarantee survival. Moreover, this argument is rather silly when you consider the empirically proven lopsided treatment of black people at the hands of the law and judicial system. Essentially, people who forward this argument are offering a disgusting dichotomy: Give in to oppression or die. Would these people have similarly asked the Jews to obey the Nazis to increase their chance of survival? As English Philosopher John Austin reminds us: the existence of law is one thing; its merit or demerit is another. Just because something is legal, doesnt mean its right. Its about time we start looking at the murderer and a little less at the behavior of the person who was murdered. Surely some people do warrant the death penalty, according to our laws (I may have to revisit this whole death penalty thing) but all people are owed due process. Its a right so important our constitution promised it twice (i.e in the 5th Amendment and 14th Amendment). Being killed by police does not fall into those parameters. You do support the Constitution, dont you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lets put the burden of proof back on the government.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The character of the murdered individual is routinely on trial when courts and juries are attempting to decide what kind of legal repercussions are to be levied against cops and other governmental actors that carry out injustices on peopl of color. But my understanding of our judicial system is that we assume individuals are innocent until they are proven guilty. If that is the case, then a murdered individual should be assumed to be wrongly killed unless the officer can prove he was acting reasonably. Surely the conduct of the murdered individual is relevant exculpatory evidence. But the evidence matters at trial. So, lets start having trials for cops. At which time they can prove their innocence. But we cant keep assuming the cop acted reasonably and the murdered person deserved to be killed. Its this current way of dealing with these situations which liberates cops to use deadly force more frequently and with less hesitation. One obvious institutional change to decrease the number of unarmed people murdered by cops, a crime disproportionately happening to people of color, is to punish that behavior with more than paid vacations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lets remember that were not talking about disembodied statistics; were talking about people.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The breadth of the influence of institutional racism is quite large. These phenomena affect so many people its easy to forget that at the end of the day were talking about individual people with lives, families, hopes, fears, and futures. As we go further and further down the rabbithole of statistics, lets not forget that fact. Whether or not youre skeptical of the accounts of racial politics commonly promulgated, people are dying. People are being denied access to promise
rights and necessary goods. People are spending their entire lives without hope. This is unacceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P. S. Good luck with your new diets, personality changes, workout plans, and goals for the New Year. I hope that you will at least consider also adopting these changes; I hope that you will also start pledging your effort to things that matter!&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>A Letter to Liberals</title><link href="http://pisgahanalytics.com/a-letter-to-liberals.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-12-24T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Juannell Riley</name></author><id>tag:pisgahanalytics.com,2014-12-24:a-letter-to-liberals.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Being a liberal puts a unique burden on a person to be particularly excellent when conveying ideas, exceptionally persistent in promoting those ideas, and painfully patient in waiting for change (not passive but just near immune to frustration). Why? Liberals challenge the status quo. We see society as it is and ask if it can be better. We refuse to accept the tired excuse: "things have always been this way" and ask if things should be different - in part because we know few things have always been any particular way. We take humanity seriously: ALL OF HUMANITY. But the thing is, the status quo in any arena is so damn comfortable, and very often changing it requires getting people to buy into a vision they may not support; a future they may not want. Sometimes change mandates sacrificing long enjoyed luxuries and privileges so that some stranger whom one will never meet can live a better life.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's a hard sell. 
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it's an even harder sell if we get lost in dogma; if we allow ourselves to get caught up in catchphrases (e.g. victim-blaming, respectability politics, etc.) without explaining the significance and relevance of those concepts; if we resort to name-calling instead of argumentation. Don't call them racists, show them their racism. Don't call them sexists, show them their sexism. Don't call them idiots, show them the fallacies they rely on. After all, a central tenet of liberal social commentary is that there are complicated and insidious mechanisms at work (e.g. racism is now a matter of how our social institutions function in a way that marginalizes and oppresses groups of people in a way predictable by skin color and historical position and not simply limited to animus and blatant discrimination). To me that suggests that an understanding of these mechanisms is not readily accessible to all people. We cannot immediately develop contempt for those who are ignorant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a liberal, you are also responsible for truly understanding the pathology of a conservative. One might want to assert that conservatives have the same responsibility, but I don't think so, primarily because most conservatives support doing nothing (i.e. keeping society relatively consistent in its workings) and to do that they dont need a very good arsenal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two kinds of conservatives. There are subsets of these kinds, but two primary camps. The first kind of conservative is thoroughly cynical. They have a bleak understanding of human nature. They also majoritarily subscribe to a kind of pragmatism. Essentially, they believe that society currently may not be perfect, but it is functional, reasonable, and stable. Change and reform threaten that stability. These conservatives worry pursuing the greater good may undermine the working society we have now, potentially resulting in chaos. Convince this kind of conservative of the necessity or utility of any reform requires showing the conservative that the aspect of the World we look to change is currently not functional, reasonable, or stable or that the reform we hope to implement would ONLY improve the functionality, reasonableness, or stability of that aspect of society, or both. Sometimes change requires simply putting their fears to rest (e.g. letting gays marry wont lead to a proliferation in beastiality).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second kind of conservative is dogmatic. This conservative may not believe society is perfect but she assumes that some force (e.g. God, the Market, etc.) will ultimately yield the best result or provide the best reference for action. Persuading this kind of conservative of anything is particularly hard since their approach to politics is admittedly not logical. To convince this kind of conservative of anything you have to show them that the potential social and legal changes you endorse are not inconsistent with their beliefs or show them the force they believe will do everything has so far not done a great job of handling things. Engaging the validity of the force they believe in is often an immediate conversation ender so try to focus on the consequences of their belief and not the substance (e.g. God doesnt want that isnt a reliable way to dictate our behavior so perhaps we shouldnt make it the litmus test for a womans reproductive choices v.s. God is not real, go fuck yourself: one approach is a lot more conducive to progress than the other).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might even be helpful to think of conservatives on a spectrum or graph that plots dogmatism and cynicality. Liberals also need to keep each other honest. Just because a reform or a change or a critique claims to service some discrete and insular entity does not grant it immunity from scrutiny. Weeding out the dogma is important for liberals. All our positions need to be coherent and tenable. Any misstep provides justification in the minds of skeptics for them to dismiss our entire platform. For that reason we must be thorough in our criticism of ourselves and willing to push each other toward perfection. I find that liberals quickly retreat into pathological argumentation, asserting how nice or kind or good something would be. But conservative pathology isnt responsive to that. More importantly, emotional reasoning is often biased, flawed, and unreliable. We need to rely almost entirely on empirical reasoning and logical deduction even when fueled by sentimental concerns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, liberality requires that one never fall in love with one means for achieving a goal. Becoming enamored with any one outcome or approach is dangerous. The primary goal of Liberal thought is to create a fair, inclusive society which enables every individual to have a realistic opportunity to achieve self-actualization. Pledging allegiance to any particular instrument of achieving that goal at the expense of the goal itself moves you from the category of liberal to fanatic. If that is your prerogative, please pursue it to your hearts content. Just dont do it under the banner of liberal; even if you resemble one. I yearn for a time when liberals will be taken seriously again. That day will only come if we stop whining and start taking ourselves seriously. That starts with recommitting ourselves to argumentation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Side note: I do think conservatives serve an important role in society. Where liberals push the boundaries, conservatives keep us safe from ourselves. The human imagination is incredible. But it is also fleeting and unreliable. If we ran with all of its crazy inventions we might indeed find ourselves in a chaotic situation. For that reason, we need practicality. Many wise conservatives provide exactly that. Democracy, after all, is a balancing act.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry></feed>
